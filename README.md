- The webpage will allow the user to filter search criteria by date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting and automatically display the filtered results.
## Results

The webpage is very user friendly, displayed results will be dynamically filtered as the filter search criteria is inputted. The tables will update in real time, thus there is no filter search button. Search criteria can be broad or very specefic as shown in examples below.

## Summary
- The webpage built has many interesting features and advantages such as dynamically displaying results in real time, however, due to the nature of the search fields and lack of existing data there are a few drawbacks that could use further development.
- One major drawback is that the search results do not account for case sensitivity, this can be fixed in the code to allow the user to type in lower or upper case letters and still get the displayerd seach results.
- A few recommendations to the site would be to include more data from before 2010 and up to the current date, as well as include data from around the world, not just in the US. The webpage and search criteria are coded in a way to allow data from around the world and filter per the users' wants. 
- Another recommendation to further develop the site would be to include a drop down list in the search criteria so that the user can search based on existing data and would reduce spelling errors and case sensitivity to make a more user friendly webpage.
